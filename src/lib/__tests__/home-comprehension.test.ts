// Phase G: first-visit comprehension, code level. A first-time visitor
// must be able to answer four questions from the home page alone:
// what Sortes does, what is free, what costs credits, and what a paid
// reading gives. The live-browser confirmation (a real person reading
// the page) is in hidden_files/phaseG-e2e-plans.md; this test pins
// the copy so a later edit cannot silently drop one of the four
// answers. It reads the page source, the same way charts-check pins
// copy elsewhere in this repo.
//
// AF-034 (homepage diet): the homepage no longer carries the pricing
// detail or the Latin line — cash prices live on /oracles, the Latin
// line was dropped, and the duplicate "All spreads" grid is gone.
// The four answers below are the diet versions: home still states
// what is free and that a reading costs 1 Oracle, and /oracles
// carries the cash price the home page used to repeat.
